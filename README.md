* who made this - made by myself.<br>
* why did you make this - I've recently learned html/php/js/css, and I needed whatever project to work on, in order to make my learnings stick.<br>
* would it be dangerous for my pc? - as far as I know, no. Since the whole php file is here, the ones who are able to may also figure it out themselves.<br>
* do you make money from visitors? - no ads on site, server is on amazon, (minus)$0.4 are made per million visitors.<br>
* how long would the site last? - one year, or more.<br>
<br>
* Leaderboards? - I've been working on it, but I've failed to link mysql database with main page. someday it may show up.
